1. If there are times when that element will not be present, you will need to add a try-catch, catch the WebDriverTimeoutException,
and return false in that case.

2. You have two approaches. Selenium has been specifically written to NOT allow interaction with hidden elements. The rational is that
   if a person cannot perform that action, then neither should Selenium. Therefore, to perform the click via Selenium, you must perform
   the action a user would do to make that button visible (e.g mouse over event, click another element, etc) then perform the click once visible.

   However, Selenium does allow you to execute Javascript within the context of an element, so you could write Javascript to perform the click
   event even if it is hidden.
   My preference is to always try and perform the actions to make the button visible
